# The Kitti Vision Benchmark Suite
A novel dataset captured from a VW station wagon for use in mobile robotics and autonomous driving research. The scenarios are captured with high- resolution color and grayscale stereo cameras, a Velodyne 3D laser scanner and a high-precision GPS/IMU inertial navigation system and contains diverse  real-world traffic situations and ranging from freeways over rural areas to inner- city scenes with many static and dynamic objects. 

# How to Use The Data
